# 100 - Container, image, and Docker

Container is a [virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization) at the operating system level. Everything needed to run an application: the code, library dependencies, and the operating system, are all defined in an image. The image is used to create containers that we would run the application inside, in a consistently repeatable and isolated fashion. We can think of a container as another lightweight virtualized operating system running on a machine, but better.

Docker is the most popular container framework that’s supported by all cloud providers and container management systems. It’s the default container solution and the name “docker” has been used almost interchangeably as “container” for a long time.
