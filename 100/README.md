# 100 - Introduction

A complex project with many dependencies used to require a long list of manual tasks to set up for local development. The task list would grow even more complex to support collaborators with Windows, Mac, and Linux machines. A single human error or a slight difference in the setup could end in all kinds of mysterious errors that are extremely hard to debug and fix.

The use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image for development environments has solved this big pain point for engineering teams and has been widely adopted in the industry.

We would cover the concepts, benefits, and steps for setting up a project to allow collaborators to use Docker for development. We would use a Python project example but the concepts and most steps apply to projects with other languages.
